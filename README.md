# An intuitive HR application for your Microsoft 365 tenant
RH App is a simple, minimalist application for handling admissions and other related employee processes. 
It requires:
+ A Sharepoint site
+ Exchange Online Server
+ Power Apps (including Power Automate)

To use it, zip the files within this repository and import it into a Power Apps project. You'll need to create the Sharepoint site and automations manually, according to your needs, and then tie them to related outputs.
