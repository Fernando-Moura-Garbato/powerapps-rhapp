# An intuitive HR application for your Microsoft 365 tenant
RH App is a simple, minimalist application for handling admissions and other related employee processes. 
It requires:
+ A Sharepoint site
+ Exchange Online Server (for automatic e-mail flows)
+ Power Apps (including Power Automate)

To use it, zip the files within this repository and import it into a Power Apps project. You'll need to create the Sharepoint site and automations manually, according to your needs, and then tie them to related outputs.
It should be noted that RH App is written in brazillian portuguese, and needs to be manually translated in order to use it with another language.
